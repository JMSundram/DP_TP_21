# DP_TP_21

### About

Repository for code used in our (Jacob and Emilies) term paper in the course "Dynamic Programming - Theory, Computation, and Empirical Applications" held by Thomas Høgholm Jørgensen and Bertel Schjerning at the Department of Economics at the University of Copenhagen in the spring of 2021. Code is confirmed working with Python 3.8.5.

### What to run

The notebook ```RUN_MAIN.ipynb``` produces all figures and results related to the model and is the only file needed to run to replicate the main results in our term paper. The folders ```calibration``` and ```estimation``` contains more notebooks to create results used for the parametrization of the model (optional).
